# Personal Finance Tools

Small Python scripts I'm using to practice coding and model real-life money questions.

## Scripts

- `monthly_snapshot.py`  
  Interactive script that:
  - Asks for income, expenses, and investing target
  - Shows base monthly savings
  - Calculates how much side-hustle income is needed to hit the target
